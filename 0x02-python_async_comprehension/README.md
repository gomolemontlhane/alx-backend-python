# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## Description

This project is about asynchronous programming in Python. It involves writing asynchronous generators, using async comprehensions, and measuring the runtime of parallel comprehensions.

## Files

- `0-async_generator.py`: A coroutine that yields random numbers asynchronously.
- `1-async_comprehension.py`: A coroutine that collects random numbers using async comprehensions.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: A coroutine that measures the runtime of executing `async_comprehension` four times in parallel.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
